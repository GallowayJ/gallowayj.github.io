		<h2>My background</h2>
		<p> 
		I spent my formative years between the UK and the Caribbean. Much of my child hood was spent outdoors
		where I developed a curiosity to better understand the natural world. This was the beginning of my interests
		in the natural sciences.

		I completed my BSc at the University of East Anglia in Environmental Science, spending one year working as an Environmental Coordinator
		for a multinational plastics manufacturer. My main responsibilities pertained to corporate social responsibility and sustainability.

		After graduation I found employment in the marketing industry. After a year I decided to quit the industry in favour of
		a return to a vocation which I felt passionate about. This lead me to relocate to Spain for an internship working in
		the international department of an environmental organisation to gain experience in project management. It was an opportunity
		which I thoroughly enjoyed and the experience made me eager to maintain a <em>European</em> perspective to my future endeavours.

		I took the decision to return to study in order to increase my expertise environmental pollutants and the modelling of their movement.
		I worked at an Environmental Monitoring Techician and later as an Environmental Technologist whilst saving to finance my return to study.
		Given my desire to continue to develop my skills in a European context I enrolled myself on a double MSc. course which promoted
		international cooperation as one of the programme's core values. In addition to achieving my aim of furthering my knowledge of 
		in Austria and Sweden, the countries where I studied.
